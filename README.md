## Presentation
Minishell is a project by 42 School, whose goal is to develop a minimalist shell inspired by Bash, capable of executing commands, managing redirections, pipes, and environment variables.
It focuses on understanding processes, managing signals and file descriptors, and implementing internal commands.

## Usage
```
make
# compiles the executable 'minishell'

./minishell
# launches the shell
```
